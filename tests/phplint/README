PHPLINT README

Phplint is a simple Tcl program that checks PHP programs trying to find
accesses to not initialized varibles. This errors are frequent in PHP
due to typos. For example consider the following code:

    $fooBar = 10;
    echo($fooBaar);
               ^
               |___ error!

The wrong variable $fooBaar will only be found by the programmer when
the program is executed and the exact line where the typo is preset
is reached (assuming E_NOTICE error level is set).

Thanks to automatic tests this kind of errors should be avoided from the
start, but the real world is not perfect so a tool trying to spot this
errors can be useful.

Please Keep in mind that phplint is very limited and is not a real PHP
parser, but just a number of regexp with some logic inside.
This program was written at my company in some hour for the real world
usage for a program we wanted to check after two weeks of
refactoring, and it was able to found many bugs, so even if limited we
hope it'll be useful for you too.

USAGE

Just try:

    tclsh phplint.tcl /my/php/program/dir/*.php

CODE ANNOTATIONS

In order to avoid that avoid that phplint false positives are reported it is
possible to annotate the source code with the following annotations:

    $x = 10; # nolint

Phplint will not analyze this above line.

    function foobar() {
        .. analyzed code ..
        # lintoff
        .. not analyzed code ..
        # linton
        .. analyzed code ..
    }

The above example allows to skip a number of lines at once
